# Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication with Android 

This is a sample project to demonstrate the commnucation between BLE and Android. Most of the tutorial are confusing. However, my BLE device is a notification type device which will send notifcation if there is any changes in the device. I set up this project in order to test a BLE device which was sent from a hardware company. Anyway, i will add a video to show demo.
